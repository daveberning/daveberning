### Ope, hey there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I'm <a href="https://daveberning.io" target="_blank">Dave Berning</a>, a software engineer and author from Cincinnati. Yeah, the Queen City, where we smother spaghetti with chili and say things like "ope" and "I'm gonna squeeze right by ya." Anyway...

I've been a front-end web developer for more than eight years. In 2015, I graduated from the University of Cincinnati, where I learned to create interactive websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently, I build rich single-page web applications with Vue.js and TypeScript.

When I'm not coding, I try to give back to the community where I can. Recently, it's through writing tutorials at Digital Ocean and speaking as the founder/co-organizer at the CodePen Cincinnati meetups. In 2018 I became a published author with Vue.js: Understanding It's Tools and Ecosystem (author) and Creating Interfaces With Bulma (co-author, co-editor). Go and tell your mom to buy my books, that's how I make money.
